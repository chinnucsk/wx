API GENERATION:
    Most of the code in wx is generated.  
    Users of wxErlang should not normally need to regenerate the generated code, 
    as it is checked in by wxErlang developers, when changes are made.
    2008-09-29 Code checked in is currently generated from wxwidgets 2.8.7.

REQUIREMENTS:
    The code generation requires doxygen (1.4.6) which is
    used to parse wxWidgets c++ headers and generate xml files (in
    wx_xml/).

    (2008-09-29 doxygen 1.4.6 is required.
    Later versions of Doxygen - up to 1.5.6 at least - have a bug in the xml generation
    which causes us problems. This has been logged and we are waiting for a fix.)

CONFIGURATION:
    wxapi.conf contains the specification to the code generator.  The code
    generator reads the specification and parses the xml files and
    produces the erlang and the 'C' code.

    Adding/changing stuff/classes should be done by updating wxapi.conf
    and running make. Sometimes the code generator will require changes,
    I havn't thought of everything yet.

CONTRIBUTION:
    Send me patches or update the svn version.
